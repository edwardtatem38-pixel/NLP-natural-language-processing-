# NLP-natural-language-processing-
end to end nlp pipeline for twitter sentiment classification, featuring GloVe and Keras/TensoFlow

🐦 Deep Learning Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
🚀 Project Summary
This project implements an end-to-end NLP solution for classifying the sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) of social media tweets.

The core technology stack focuses on deep learning: a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network built with Keras/TensorFlow for sequence modeling, and GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) for advanced feature extraction.
